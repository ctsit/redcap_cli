# REDCap CLI Contributors

The REDCap Command Line Interface was spun off UF CTS-IT's RED-I project in
2015. We thank David R Nelson, his HCV Target project and the University of
Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute for providing the seed
funding that launched the RED-I Project and early versions of this tool.  We
would also like to thank Christopher P. Barnes (senrabc@gmail.com), Director
of CTS-IT, for his guidance in open source project development.

Philip Chase (philipbchase@gmail.com) is the primary author and current
maintainer of the redcap_cli project.

For their contributions of code and ideas we would like to thank Ruchi Desai,
Andrei Sura, Philip Chase, Nicholas Rejack, and Taeber Rapczak.
